    <h1>WANG YI MEI</h1>
    <!-- STORY TIME -->
    <!-- Please rephrase omg -->
    <p>I am a full stack web developer looking for job opportunities.</p>
    <p>I have strong problem-solving skills and am great at logical thinking.</p>
    <p>In my past life, I was a primary school teacher teaching English and Social Studies.</p>
    <p>But I knew it was not my calling. I felt lost because I didn't know what to do.</p>
    <p>Then I met coding and fell in love.</p>
