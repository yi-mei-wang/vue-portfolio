    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <!-- STORY TIME -->
    <!-- Please rephrase omg -->
    <p>I am a full stack web developer looking for full time and freelance opportunities.</p>
    <p>In my past life, I was a Psychology graduate who went on to become an English teacher. While it was an enjoyable experience, I knew working with children was not my calling. I felt lost then because I didn't know what to do.</p>
    <p>That was until I met programming and the rest, as they said, was history.</p>
    <p>I started with C and swiftly fell in love (seriously). I eventually moved on to Python and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>My strengths include strong problem-solving, debugging skills, and logical thinking skills, traits that make me a good programmer.</p>
    <p>Contact me via any of the channels below. I would love to talk to you about how I can help you achieve your design and/or development goals.</p>
